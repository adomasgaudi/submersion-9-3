  //- p The language learning industry is inflexible enough to support this growing trend as that would undermine the significance of thousands of grammar books. 
  //- p Actually, your school is likely even worse off, since it is probably forced by the local education departments to follow a grammar book even if the teacher had other ideas.
  //- p So ok, everyone knows that reading and watching movies in the target language. Is useful. So what. What is the use that they know, if they still force the students to spend the majority of class time with booring grammar textbooks. The proportions are wrong. If they knew just how much a person can learn from simply engaging with content and how little one learn when one is not interested, they would through out every book they have.
